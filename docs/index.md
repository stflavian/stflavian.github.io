# Hey there! 👋🏼

I’m Flavian Stavarache, an Applied Physics graduate from the Technical University of 
Eindhoven with a passion for turning scientific ideas into practical solutions. Over 
the past few years I’ve gathered experience in materials modelling on a variety of 
systems, ranging from novel battery materials to computational tools that speed up 
the study of adsorption.

My background blends applied physics, molecular modelling, and a good dose of 
programming, so I’m comfortable moving between theory, code, and real‑world 
applications. I also enjoy mentoring students and sharing what I learn through 
tutorials and open‑source projects.

This site is an aggregation of many things: a snapshot of my research interests and 
active projects, a résumé‑style "business card", and a storage place for the concepts 
I’m learning along the way. Feel free to browse the tutorials, reach out with 
questions, or just say hello!
