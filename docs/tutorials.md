# Tutorials

Welcome! This corner of the site gathers a set of short tutorials that extend the 
official documentation of several third‑party programs. They are not meant to replace 
the original manuals, but just to show how the concepts can be applied to the specific 
workflows I find useful.

## Why not stick to the original manuals?

This is a good question, for which I have a few answers:

1. These tutorials act as a friendly supplement to the manuals. I take the official 
docs of each program, read them, and add step‑by‑step examples that helped me get 
things done. That way I also get to clarify aspects which I find unclear in the
manual.
2. The tutorials are focused on real tasks and every guide walks through a workflow 
that I actually use, hoping it might be handy for anyone working with the same 
software.
3. I like learning from examples, so having production-ready input files is handy.

You may also wonder why am I not contributing to the original manuals myself to make
them clearer, instead of writing everything from scratch. The short answer: I do plan
on contributing to the original documentation, but I find it easier to make my own
tutorials following my own style guides and then adapting them to fit the original
documentation.

## Who Might Find This Helpful?

These tutorials (will hopefully) cover a variety of computational chemistry packages 
and (maybe) programming languages that I often use. As such, I suspect the target 
audience would be:

- Any computational material scientist and theoretical chemist tackling similar 
tasks using one of the listed programs who is looking for a quick, practical reference.
- Students who prefer learning through concrete examples next to a manual.
